"""Writing skin files safely, and cleaning up after ourselves.

Two hazards drove every decision here, both found by reading the Hermes source
rather than by guessing.

HAZARD 1 — THE TORN-READ LATCH
`tui_gateway/change_watcher.py:_broadcast_skin_if_changed` records the file's new
mtime signature BEFORE it parses the YAML:

    sig = _skin_sig()
    if sig == _last_skin_sig: return
    _last_skin_sig = sig            # <-- accepted here
    _broadcast_global_event("skin.changed", resolve_skin())   # <-- parsed here

and `skin_engine._load_skin_from_yaml` swallows a parse failure and returns None,
whereupon `load_skin` silently falls back to the DEFAULT skin. So if the watcher
stats a half-written file, it accepts that mtime, renders the default palette, and
— if our completed write lands on the same mtime — stays wrong until something
unrelated changes. A partial write is not a cosmetic glitch here; it LATCHES.

Therefore: never write the live file in place. Write a sibling temp file, fsync it,
validate the complete bytes, then atomically rename. os.replace is atomic on POSIX
and on Windows, so a reader sees either the old file or the new one, never a
fragment.

HAZARD 2 — SPARSE FORKS DO NOT INHERIT WHAT YOU THINK
`skin_engine._build_skin_config` merges a skin's `colors` block over the BUILT-IN
DEFAULT, not over some other skin. Skin-to-skin inheritance does not exist. A sparse
per-session file therefore inherits Hermes' default gold palette, not our dialect,
and looks broken in a way that is genuinely hard to diagnose. So every file we write
is fully MATERIALIZED: base dialect resolved first, our deltas applied on top, every
key present.

Also: the YAML's internal `name:` field is authoritative for identity and for
`list_skins()` discovery, so each per-session file carries its own unique name.
Duplicate internal names collapse into one entry in the picker.
