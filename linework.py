WHY THIS IS TEXT: a plugin cannot paint arbitrary terminal pixels through semantic
skin keys. Rich markup is ours to emit, so each cell can carry one measured pigment.
The rule therefore samples the same coherent, seeded body grammar as the mantle
instead of cycling a palette by x-coordinate (the old output was terminal tinsel).
