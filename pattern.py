"""The chronic/acute renderer: turning an identity + a signal into a live palette.

Named for the biology. Hanlon & Messenger (1988) split cuttlefish body patterns into
CHRONIC patterns (minutes to hours; crypsis and identity) and ACUTE patterns (seconds
to minutes; communication). This module keeps that split literally:

    PATTERN = CHRONIC(identity) + [ACUTE(signal) if signal is not resting]

The chronic layer is the session's own colour and never changes for the life of the
session. The acute layer is layered ON TOP when the session needs the human, and is
RELEASED when it no longer does, revealing the chronic layer intact underneath.

That release behaviour is not a stylistic choice; it is what the animal does. Nature
(2023) measured blanching in Sepia officinalis: the response is fast, direct, converges
to the same appearance regardless of the starting camouflage, *retains a trace of the
prior pattern*, and the animal returns to that prior pattern afterwards in 16 of 17
trials. So: the acute signal may override identity, but it must never destroy it.

Three render layers, one per real dermal element type:

  leucophores   - passive broadband reflectors -> the neutral base (background,
                  surfaces). Adapts to the ambient terminal rather than fighting it.
  iridophores   - structural interference colour -> the sheen (accents, rules,
                  borders). This is the layer that carries the identity hue.
  chromatophores- active muscular pigment sacs -> the ink (text, glyphs, the one
                  live signal). The only layer the acute channel touches.

A flat single-hue tint is what makes most "session colour" tools look cheap. Depth
comes from these three layers behaving differently: the base stays quiet, the sheen
carries identity, the ink carries meaning.
