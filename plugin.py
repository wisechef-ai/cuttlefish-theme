"""Hermes plugin entrypoint for cuttlefish-theme.

Everything here goes through the documented plugin surface — `register_cli_command`,
`register_hook`, `ctx.get_config`. No Hermes core file is modified, which is both
the owner's constraint and upstream's own rule (plugins/AGENTS.md: "Plugins never
touch core").

Lifecycle:

  session start -> allocate an identity against the currently-live sessions, paint
                   the mantle, SETTLE into it (the tortuous camouflage search), start
                   the slow watcher, and sweep skins orphaned by an earlier crash.
  during        -> the watcher checks every 2s and does nothing at all unless the
                   state changed; when it does, the transition is ANIMATED
                   (blanch on a new signal, recover on its release) and then the
                   session is perfectly still again.
  session end   -> stop the animator, restore the previous skin if we still own the
                   current one (compare-and-set), and delete our file.

The compare-and-set on restore matters: if the user ran /skin themselves while we
were active, blindly reverting would stomp their choice. We only put back what we
took if nothing else has changed it since.
