"""`hermes cuttlefish watch|legend|doctor|demo|skin` — the human-facing surfaces.

`watch` is the multiplexer: one line per live session, its identity colour, its
short name, what it needs, and for how long. It is the surface where the whole
design pays off, because it is the only place all sessions are visible at once.

It is strictly READ-ONLY. It reads the session registry and prints; it never writes
a skin, never touches config, and cannot disturb a running session. That is what
makes it safe to run anywhere, including against a production box.

  cuttlefish \u2014 the language

  Modelled on cuttlefish, which layer two kinds of pattern:

    CHRONIC  lasts minutes to hours   \u2192  who this session is
    ACUTE    lasts seconds            \u2192  what it needs from you

  Every appearance is:  CHRONIC(identity) + ACUTE(signal, only when needed)

  YOUR IDENTITY
    Each session gets its own colour and its own name, allocated so that no two
    sessions visible at the same time look alike. It never changes while the
    session lives \u2014 that is what makes it recognisable.

  THE THREE SIGNALS
    {swatch('#3BA8C4')}  resting      the session's own colour, no badge.
                     Working, thinking, or idle \u2014 all mean "leave it alone",
                     so all look the same. Nothing to do.

    {swatch('#FFC061')}  INPUT 4m     amber. It is blocked ON YOU, and has been
                     for 4 minutes. The number is text because a colour
                     cannot tell you how long.

    {swatch('#D2544F')}  ERROR 2m     red. It failed and cannot continue.
                     The identity colour survives underneath and returns
                     when the fault clears \u2014 exactly as a cuttlefish
                     blanches at a threat and then recovers its pattern.

  That is the entire language: one identity, three signals, one composition rule.

  HOW IT MOVES

    At rest, nothing moves. A cuttlefish holds its pattern; so does your terminal.
    Motion happens only at transitions, each following a measured curve
    (Woo et al., Nature 619, 2023):

      blanch    0.4s   fast and direct, all at once      - a signal arrives
      recover   2.4s   slower, decelerating, staggered   - the signal clears
      settle    1.6s   meandering, pausing, converging   - a session begins

    Pattern components regroup on every transition, so the same change never
    animates the same way twice.
