"""Behaviour contracts for the multi-pigment mantle.

The mantle is the theme's identity channel. A flat background cannot be one: one
hex has three numbers and two are spent on "dark enough to read on" and "not pure
black". Six sessions measured 0.0148 OKLab apart that way — six blacks. A 30x30
grid has 900 cells, and (since 2026-09-09) three pigment classes per session, so
it has room to be an identity AND a state display at once.
