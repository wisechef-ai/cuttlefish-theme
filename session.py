"""Read Hermes' live-session registry and reduce it to a colour-signal model.

Chromatophore is a peripheral-display layer: it gives each terminal session a
unique colour identity plus a three-level state signal, in the spirit of a
cuttlefish's skin. This module owns the read side of that — everything the
plugin knows about *which sessions are live* — and the entire state vocabulary
the product can express.

HONESTY NOTE — WHERE THE SIGNAL COMES FROM (read this before extending):
    The Hermes registry (``<HERMES_HOME>/runtime/active_sessions.json``, writer:
    ``hermes_cli/active_sessions.py``) records only LEASE information:
    session_id, pid, surface, timestamps, and the owner's process start time.
    It does NOT record the agent's pet/activity state (idle/run/review/waiting/
    failed/...). Therefore a :class:`Signal` CANNOT be derived from the registry
    alone today, and this module refuses to invent one. The API is shaped so a
    caller who DOES know the state (e.g. an in-process hook, or a future Hermes
    that publishes state into the registry) supplies it via
    :func:`collapse(pet_state)`; absent/unknown state collapses to RESTING, the
    visually silent default. Do not fake a state source: a wrong NEEDS_ME is
    worse than an honest RESTING, because it trains the user to ignore colour.
